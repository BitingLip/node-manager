# C# Orchestrator ‚Üî Python Workers Alignment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic 4-phase approach to analyze and resolve alignment between the C# .NET orchestrator and Python workers implementation. The goal is to identify what needs to be fixed to ensure proper integration and eliminate stub/mock implementations.

### Architecture Principles

- **Python Responsibilities**: ML operations, model loading/unloading from shared cache, PyTorch DirectML functionality
- **Communication**: JSON over STDIN/STDOUT between C# services and Python workers
- **No Backwards Compatibility**: Complete fre**üéØ SYSTEMATIC 4-PHASE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK COMPLETE**

### Phase 4 Progress Status
- **‚úÖ Device Foundation**: Communication reconstruction validated and operational
- **‚úÖ Memory Integration**: Vortice.Windows integration validated with proper responsibility separation
- **‚úÖ Model Coordination**: Validation plan complete - Ready for hybrid C#/Python coordination testing

- **‚úÖ Inference Gold Standard**: Validation plan complete - Ready for peak performance validation with complete infrastructure
- **‚úÖ Postprocessing Excellence**: Validation plan complete - Ready for final excellence confirmation with complete system integration

### Next Action: Execute Validation Plans or Begin Implementation
**All 6 domains now have comprehensive Phase 4 validation plans ready for execution. The systematic 4-phase alignment analysis and validation framework is complete.**tructure as needed

### Domain Priority Order

1. **Device** - Hardware discovery and management foundation
2. **Memory** - Memory allocation and monitoring (C# with Vortice)
3. **Model** - Model caching (C#) and loading (Python) coordination
4. **Processing** - Workflow and session management
5. **Inference** - ML inference execution
6. **Postprocessing** - Image enhancement and safety checking
