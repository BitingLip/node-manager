## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Memory-Aware Batch Processing
```python
class EnhancedBatchManager:
    """
    Advanced batch processing with intelligent memory management:
    - Dynamic sizing based on VRAM usage (threshold: 85%)
    - Real-time memory monitoring and adjustment
    - Progressive batch distribution optimization
    - Comprehensive metrics and progress tracking
    """
```

### Key Performance Features
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts batch size from 1-4 based on memory availability
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks VRAM usage with 100-entry rolling history
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time callbacks with ETA, memory usage, and success metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if individual batches fail
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cleanup every 3 batches to prevent memory fragmentation

### Batch Distribution Examples
- **5 images**: Distributed as [2,2,1] across 3 batches
- **8 images**: Distributed as [3,3,2] across 3 batches  
- **10 images**: Distributed as [4,4,2] across 3 batches (max batch size: 4)
