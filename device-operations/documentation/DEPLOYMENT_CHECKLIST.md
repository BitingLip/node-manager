   - [ ] Monitor deployment logs for errors
   - [ ] Verify all containers start successfully
   - [ ] Check resource utilization

### Post-Deployment Verification
4. [ ] **Health Checks**
   - [ ] Basic health endpoint responding: `/health`
   - [ ] Detailed health endpoint responding: `/health/detailed`
   - [ ] All health checks passing
   - [ ] No error logs in application logs

5. [ ] **API Testing**
   - [ ] Device discovery endpoint working: `/api/device/list`
   - [ ] Authentication working with configured methods
   - [ ] Sample inference request working
   - [ ] API documentation accessible: `/api-docs`

6. [ ] **Monitoring Verification**
   - [ ] Prometheus metrics collecting: `:9090`
   - [ ] Grafana dashboards loading: `:3000`
   - [ ] Log aggregation working: `:5341`
   - [ ] Alerts configured and firing correctly

7. [ ] **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Load testing completed
   - [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
   - [ ] Response times acceptable
   - [ ] Concurrent request handling verified

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate Tasks (Within 24 hours)
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**
  - [ ] Monitor application logs for errors
  - [ ] Verify all health checks remain green
  - [ ] Check resource utilization trends
  - [ ] Verify backup jobs are running

### Short-term Tasks (Within 1 week)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Analyze performance metrics
  - [ ] Optimize based on real usage patterns
  - [ ] Tune caching settings
  - [ ] Adjust resource allocations if needed

- [ ] **Security Review**
  - [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
  - [ ] Verify security headers are working
  - [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
  - [ ] Review and rotate secrets if needed

### Long-term Tasks (Within 1 month)
- [ ] **Capacity Planning**
  - [ ] Analyze usage patterns and growth
  - [ ] Plan for scaling requirements
  - [ ] Review and optimize costs
  - [ ] Plan for model updates and additions

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Health checks failing for more than 5 minutes
- [ ] Error rate exceeding 5% for more than 2 minutes
- [ ] Memory usage exceeding 90% for more than 1 minute
- [ ] Response time exceeding 30 seconds for more than 1 minute

### Manual Rollback Process
1. [ ] **Stop Current Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down --timeout 30
   ```

2. [ ] **Restore from Backup**
   ```bash
   # Restore database
   docker run --rm -v device-operations_postgres_data:/target -v /backup:/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/postgres_data.tar.gz -C /target
   
   # Restore volumes
   docker run --rm -v device-operations_device_outputs:/target -v /backup:/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/device_outputs.tar.gz -C /target
   ```

3. [ ] **Start Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git checkout previous-stable-tag
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. [ ] **Verify Rollback**
   - [ ] Health checks passing
   - [ ] Core functionality working
   - [ ] No data loss occurred

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Won't Start
- **Check**: Container logs with `docker-compose logs device-operations`
- **Check**: Configuration files for syntax errors
- **Check**: Environment variables are properly set
- **Check**: Required volumes are mounted correctly

#### Health Checks Failing
- **Check**: Python workers are starting correctly
- **Check**: Database connection is working
- **Check**: Required models are accessible
- **Check**: Memory usage is not exceeding limits

#### High Memory Usage
- **Action**: Restart application containers
- **Action**: Clear model cache
- **Action**: Reduce concurrent operations
- **Action**: Scale horizontally if possible

#### API Endpoints Not Responding
- **Check**: NGINX configuration and logs
- **Check**: Rate limiting settings
- **Check**: SSL certificate validity
- **Check**: Network connectivity

#### Performance Issues
- **Check**: Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Check**: Database performance and queries
- **Check**: Model loading times
- **Check**: Network latency
